      <h2>Hello, my name is Sarah!</h2>
      <p>Through elements of design, development, and discovery I create and test solutions to improve usability,
        incorporating methodologies and theory of UX/UI & visual design, industry standards & best practices. I
        empathize with users, research, collect data, draw patterns, ideate potential solutions, prototype and iterate
        towards user-centric design, helping to bridge the gap between humans and technology. </p>
      <h4>This is me with my husband, Jeff.</h4>
      <p>My interests are diverse and range from the natural sciences including studies in molecular biology and organic
        chemistry, to creative explorations in essential oil blending as well as handmade artisanal gemstone and fossil
        jewelry, and now into the tech world of web development, web design, and software engineering.</p>
      <p>When I want to get into the creative code and design zone, I'll sometimes listen to inspiring chill music.
        Check out the video for a taste of what I'm listening to lately.</p>
